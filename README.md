# kmeans-cpp

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm in C++. The algorithm is used to partition a set of samples into distinct clusters based on their features.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Python 3.9 or later (optional, for data generation and visualization)

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Point.cpp KMeans.cpp -o kmeans
Run the compiled executable:
./kmeans
